# dataset_suicide_susceptible
This is a comprehensive collection of data aimed at understanding and mitigating the factors contributing to student suicides. 
The dataset comprises 14 input features, including age, gender, mental health support, academic pressure, experiences of caste/religious discrimination, mental harassment, relationship issues, depression, academic misconduct (caught in UFM), family problems, feelings of life frustration, sexual assault/harassment and blackmail, mental stress, and online gaming addiction. Each feature is binary, denoted as either 1 for "yes" and 0 for "no".
